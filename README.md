The files contained in this repo are various Optimisation Algorithms that are used to find local minima/maxima of a specific function.
Each .py file contains the full algorithm implemented for an example function. The corresponding Jupyter Notebook contains precisely the
same algorithm with the example function, but is more convenient to view the output of the algorithm in the text viewer mode of the Notebook.

In each file, there are comments where a user must change the code to run for their specific function. A familiarisation with the 
algorithms are necessary to make effective use of these files.
